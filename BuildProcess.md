# Admin Dashboard Project

## My process

**Day-1** **_January 10, 2025_**

- I started by setting up the project repository on GitHub and cloning it to my local machine.
- I then initiaized a new Next.js project using the following command:

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

- I pushed the initial project setup to GitHub.

**Day-2** **_January 12, 2025_**

- I installed the necessary dependencies for the project like `@mui/material`, `@mui/styled-engine-sc`, `@mui/x-date-pickers`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `dayjs`, and `firebase`.
- I set up the layout components and created the initial folder structure for the project.
- I created theme files for light and dark mode and set up the Redux store.
- I created provider components for the theme and Redux store.
- I created protected routes for the dashboard pages.
- I pushed the changes to GitHub.
